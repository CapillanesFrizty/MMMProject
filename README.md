+:root -> the :root selector matches the document's root element. In HTML, the root element is always the html element and the html element refers to <html></html>.

+var() -> The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.

@@ Syntax: @@

+:root {
-  css declarations; ❌❌
or 
+  --name:value; ✅✅
}

-var(--name, value)❌❌
or
+var(--name) <- use this when we do css declaration in root✅✅

@@ How to use: @@
Ex.
+body{color: var(--name-of-the-property)} -> please dont be confuse its just a 1 line css 🫣🫣 ✅✅ 

!PS: if a css is declared in the :root{} it is globaly declared, it means that you can access a css declaration in any css file
